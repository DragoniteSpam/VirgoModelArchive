# VirgoModelArchive

Squash a bunch of 3D models together into a single file, for use in Game Maker, or whatever else you want to use it for.

Most people would have you load in obj or d3d or whatever files into Game Maker one-at-a-time, but if you've got a lot of them that becomes excruciatingly slow, and also they're pretty easy for users to mess with if you don't obfuscate them. This aims to take care of that.

At some point I'll document how you'd go about getting the data from the files, but until I do that it shouldn't be too hard to just read stuff out of the files in the order that it gets written in.
